* New submission

* Package was archived on CRAN

* Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:

This is a re-submission of the first catmap package as archived on CRAN (with some improvements to plot routines). I am unable to reach the original maintainer, Kristin Nicodemus, by e-mail (using the archived address and another found online). I think the original catmap package is effectively orphaned. Otherwise, I can re-submit as "catmap2"?

I have reviewed the DESCRIPTION and attest it does not contain any mis-spellings.
